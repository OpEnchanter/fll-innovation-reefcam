 FLL Innovation Project - Reef Cameras

This is part of the innovation project my teammates and I are working on for our FIRST Lego League innovation project, the idea of this project is a website where people can watch artificial reefs (Made from abandoned oil rigs) and can report anything unusual about the reefs to scientists (Ex. Discoloration of sea plants, sickness in sea life and invasive species)
